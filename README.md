DriverPass is a company focused on helping students prepare for their DMV driving tests by offering online classes, practice tests, and on-the-road training. The client, DriverPass, wanted a web-based system that would allow students to register, schedule lessons, track their practice test results, and access training materials. They also needed backend functionality for administrative staff to manage users, monitor activities, and update course offerings.

I did particularly well in clearly outlining the business requirements by aligning user roles with specific system functionalities. I also structured the technical specifications logically in the system design document, showing how the system would be scalable, secure, and user-friendly.

If I could revise one part, I would improve the level of detail in the UML diagrams. I would include more specific examples in the use case and sequence diagrams to better illustrate user flows through the system.

I interpreted the userâ€™s needs by carefully analyzing the interview transcript and identifying specific pain points, such as the need for easy scheduling and secure access. I then translated those needs into clear functional and technical requirements. Considering user needs is crucial because it ensures that the system is both usable and effective, leading to higher customer satisfaction and system success.

I approach designing software by first thoroughly understanding user requirements, then creating structured documents like business requirements and system designs before coding begins. In the future, I will incorporate even more iterative feedback loops, such as user personas, wireframing, and prototype testing early in the design phase to catch usability issues sooner.
